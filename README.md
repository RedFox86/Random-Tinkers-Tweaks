This mod is a collection of small tweaks and changes to the Tinkers Construct mod that I feel make it more fun / balanced.

Requires [Tinkers Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct) (obviously) and by extension [Mantle](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mantle) to use.

Current features:

- Adds a seared alloyer to compliment the scorched variant from base Tinker's Construct
- Adds aluminum brass casts back (use a mod such as my mod Metalica to get the the material for aluminum brass in game)
- Adds shovels and a shovel head part back

Huge credit to KnightMiner from the Tinker's Construct team for helping me with understanding the inner workings of their mod

As with all my mods, feel free to use this mod in your modpack :P
